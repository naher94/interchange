This project imagines a city that allows us to gain experiences in many different places, and with many different people. Spatially speaking, this implies blurring edges, rethinking boundaries and allowing for more porous transitions between in- and outside. Such spatial qualities are not new to East Liberty, but in fact result from careful observations of the existing urban milieu. The project ‘Resilient Porosity’ aims at enhancing the existing structure of East Liberty by providing a network of public spaces where people of different classes, races and interests can mix in small scale neighborhood clusters.

During urban renewal in the 1970s, superblocks were introduced
to East liberty in order to segregate pedestrian from
automobile flows. Meanwhile the lack of building density
within the superblocks also led to vast open, undefined and
often neglected public spaces.
In the past, East Liberty was subject to divestment and
shrinking, leaving many vacant lots in between existing
building. Our proposal reinterprets the resulting porosity
of the urban fabric as a potential asset for creating a fine
grain network of public spaces punctured by buildings of
varying scales, and a mix of market rate and affordable
housing.
The existing diversity of building scales and uses is essential
to East Liberty’s vitality, as it attracts different socio-
economic classes and a variety of commercial opportunities.
Our proposal aims at maintaining such diversity,
while further integrating and evenly distributing buildings
and programs of different nature and type. Accordingly
the master-plan is based on a wide variety of building and
green space typologies.

We studied building typology and categorised them in small, medium, and large scale. In this way, we understood how open space, architecture, cirluation and human behaviors are organized and mixed in the context. These building types can be regarded as puzzle pieces to form the community.

Then based on context and future visions, a set or organizing rules are established to direct further design. These can also be used as tools to educate residents to design their own living neighborhood.

By breaking down the big box, the Whole Foods, a more interactive and porous space can be formulated.

At corners of the big blocks, vacant and unused space can be restored and transformed into public space with moveable furniture and planters. Residents can enjoy a cup of coffee at the coffee shop at the corner, chat with friends at the plaza and listen to the live music.

Within community clusters, residents cooperate to maintain the urban garden and communicate with each other.
