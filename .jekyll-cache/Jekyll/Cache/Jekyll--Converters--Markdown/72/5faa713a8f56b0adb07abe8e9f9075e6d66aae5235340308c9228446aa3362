I"ú<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Vivian and I am currently a third year BA in architecture student with an additional major in business administration. I am interested in how I can apply the skills I have learned through business administration to help improve the architecture industry. I am currently seeking summer internship opportunities that can intertwine my interests in business and architecture together, for example but not limited to real estate or management. Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with me!</p>
