Nestled in Harlem, NYC, PS101 plans to become the next Edible Schoolyard of NYC. A project begun by Alice Waters in Berkeley CA, this project incorporates the original goals of the Edible Schoolyard within a new setting. This project creates a space for learning about food production, preparation, and distribution, while at the same time becoming the real locus for a community. 

Inspired by David Gissen’s work “Subnature: Architecture’s Other Environments,” I explored how forgotten variables can affect architecture: ATMOSPHERE, the potential confrontations to the existence of modern urban society, MATTER, markers of social transformation, history, and time, and LIFE, elements like ivy and moss which question the dominant role of architecture. Drawing from this work, I was inspired to analyze the site in order to determine the subnatures of PS101 and produce a design that emphasized their positive qualities.
