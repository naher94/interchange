Originally from New Hampshire, I am a 5th year Bachelor of Architecture student with a minor in technical writing.
Outside of school, I have run an office for Vector Marketing Corporation as a Pilot Sales Manager in Fairfield, Connecticut every summer since 2015. In this position I interviewed, hired, trained and developed hundreds of people within the company. From this experience I learned the value of communication and leadership within a business setting and have grown tremendously as a person over the past three years. I now hope to apply these skills within an architectural setting and broaden my experience in the field.
