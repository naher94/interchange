Hi! I'm a fourth year architecture student and am minoring in social and political history at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m interested in architecture that has positive impacts environmentally and socially and try to embed these notions into design through ideas of materiality and tactility. I am looking for an internship this summer as I work toward licensure and would like to gain experience at a firm which engages in work of multiple scales and program types.
