What am I? An Artist? Designer? Engineer? I've never quite been able to fit neatly into any description, but fitting into a specific box has never been on my to-do list. It's for this reason that specific path of study in college was difficult to pin down; the possibilities that piqued my interests were endless. My drive comes from a passion for the creative and practical elements that make up our daily lives, diving into the things I discover with a spirited curiosity.  Now a Junior at Carnegie Mellon University, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture with a Minor in Physics (completed 2017) and a Minor in Computer Science (pursuing).
