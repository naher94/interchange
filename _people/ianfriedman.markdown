"I am a graduating senior in the BA in Architecture program with a Minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I plan to enter into CMU’s MS in Computational Design program with advanced standing - graduating in December 2019.
The integration of advanced computational techniques into architectural decision making is incredibly exciting to me, and is something I spend a great deal of time thinking about. I am primarily interested in leveraging computation to extend the analytic abilities and productivity of architects and real estate developers. If this sounds interesting to you, let’s get in touch – I’m always up for a conversation! "
