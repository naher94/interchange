Architect and currently in 2nd year of MUD, passionate about urban place-making, neighborhood revitalization, and systems design. Interested in urban data analytics and the use of different software to aid the design process as well as to create interactive environments. Believe that understanding the community's concerns and hopes are crucial for any urban intervention. Volunteered for awareness programs and co-organized events in the past and would like to be able to do so again if possible.
