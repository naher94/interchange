As a New York native raised in a 121-year-old former school building I have always been surrounded by inspiring architecture. I have learnt about concepts behind the built environment of my home town by studying Architecture at CMU ‘18. I have also been able to add to New York’s structures by interning at Caples Jefferson Architects in Queens for the past four summers. As buildings rise and fall at a rapid rate in my neighborhood of Prospect Heights, I have seen firsthand how architecture can change a community. I would like to have a positive impact on the communities surrounding the of projects I help to create.
