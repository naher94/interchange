I'm currently a third-year student in the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm also pursuing an additional major in Human-Computer Interaction through the School of Computer Science. I believe that there’s an inclination to design within everyone, so I work to enable those hidden designers within. I actively work on physical and mobile solutions to the growing problems of urban and spatial schemes. I recognize the level at which mobile connectivity is integrated in our daily lives, and instead of fighting it, I design to more deeply explore these synergies in my work.
