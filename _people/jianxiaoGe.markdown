Hi! I'm Jianxiao Ge and you can call me David. I'm currently a second-year Master of Urban Design student at Carnegie Mellon University, applying for a full-time job starting from 2019 summer. I come from Hangzhou, China and got the Bachelor degree in Landscape Architecture from Taiwan Tunghai University in 2017. I had previous internship experiences as the landscape architect, urban designer, and research assistant in Hangzhou, Taipei, and Pittsburgh. I feel particularly passionate about building a healthier framework for the community and reactivating regional development by design. Please feel free to contact me via email or phone anytime!
