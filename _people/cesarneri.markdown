Hi! I'm a fifth year student finishing up my Bachelor of Architecture with an additional major in Human-Computer Interaction. My goal as a designer is to craft environments that foster engaging and meaningful interactions.  

Last summer I worked with the people over at <a href="https://www.sosolimited.com" class="external" target="_blank">Sosolimited</a>, where I was responsible for helping with various projects at different stages of the design process. I'm currently looking for full time opportunities where I could continue to collaborate at the boundary of disciplines.
