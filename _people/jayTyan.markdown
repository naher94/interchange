I am a 2nd-year M.Arch student with a B.S.Arch from the University of Michigan. I have a strong interest in building construction and enjoy fabricating and assembling things by hand. I am also passionate about historical preservation, adaptive reuse, building deconstruction, and their roles in keeping regional, cultural assets relevant in America's ever-changing Rust Belt. For the last four years, I have been researching the network of social, political, and economic issues surrounding concentrated poverty in the U.S. I am working alongside instructors, peers, and neighbors to increase the quality and availability of low-income affordable housing and build a more equitable future.
