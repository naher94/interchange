goal: Internship
project: 3D Printer UI
projtext: "I was the lead designer responsible for the touchscreen interface of Formlabs' SLS 3D printer. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of active prints and overall printer status, queue new jobs, and change system settings. The interface also features a live feed of the print area and a maintenance checklist that guides users through cleaning steps and potential error modes.

I worked closely with the engineering team to ensure the UI communicated technical knowledge and sensor data in an accurate and user-friendly format, and collaborated with the industrial design team on human factors decisions."

Malika is a first year master's student in Computational Design with unique experiences across industrial design, data visualization, and interaction design. She is seeking summer opportunities in design, with a particular interest in interactions where physical meets digital. Accustomed to ambiguity and quickly picking up new skills, she is a self-starter and natural leader who can always figure out a way to get things done. She enjoys working collaboratively and solving problems that don't have template solutions.

Malika grew up in Boston and then Dubai, and still enjoys traveling (when possible), baking, and rock climbing.
