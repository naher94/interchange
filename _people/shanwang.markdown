Hi, I'm Shan. I am a third-year student at Carnegie Mellon University, currently pursuing Bachelor of Architecture with an additional major in Human Computer Interaction.
I am passionate about creating immersive experiences which address real needs through creative applications of new technologies.
Outside of school I like to spend time reading, throwing potteries, playing the guitar and traveling to different cities for good food.
