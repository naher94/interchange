I am a current a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Architecture degree with minors in Physical Computing and Digital Fabrication. I view myself as a maker and am interested in the roles and interactions materiality can play in one’s life, as well as the process of fabrication and creating, with interests ranging from objects and environments to even fashion.  I aim to create works that re-instill beliefs and create memories of exploration, wonder and surprise within people (values we are slowly losing). I am looking for environments that similarly value aspects of creativity, collaboration across disciplines, and change.
