I will graduate from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.Arch in May 2018. Currently, I am pursuing an architectural thesis which confronts current border politics and aims to subvert existing borders by speculating ambiguity of agency and control over space.

Outside of school, I am a curatorial assistant of Point Line Projects–exploring exhibitions of public interest design, methods of education, and inclusivity of the profession. These experiences inform my understanding of the built environment and the modes of architectural practices.

I am seeking opportunities to obtain licensure, to expand my vocabulary within the discourse, and to enhance design skills.
