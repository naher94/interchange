I am a fifth year B.Arch. student with a double-minor in Architectural History and Intelligent Environments. My multi-disciplinary education allows me to incorporate my avocation and observations of the world around me into my architectural work. I believe that architecture is a rich field that directly affects the way that people live and its roots in history and the natural environment must be acknowledged and respected.

Outside of architecture, my interests include history, public policy, performance art, biology, movies, writing, and crocheting.
